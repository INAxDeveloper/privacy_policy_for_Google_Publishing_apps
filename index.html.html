      <div class="meta">Last updated: <strong>[YYYY-MM-DD]</strong></div>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>[Your App Name]</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the information that we obtain through the <strong>[Your App Name]</strong> mobile application (the "App").</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Information you provide directly, such as name, email address, or profile photo when you create an account or contact support.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous or pseudonymous information about how you use the App (pages/screens visited, features used, timestamps, crash logs).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Device model, OS version (e.g. Android 15), unique device identifiers, and locale settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Media & Files:</strong> Photos, videos or files you choose to upload or create within the App (only if your app uses media features).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features.</li>
        <li>Respond to your support requests and communicate important updates.</li>
        <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues, analyze usage, and monitor performance.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations where required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
      <p>The App may request the following permissions based only on the features you use. We request and explain them at runtime.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> — To allow users to take photos or videos within the App. Photos are saved only if you choose to save or upload them.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage / Files</strong> — To save or read files that the App creates or that you explicitly choose to open with the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> — <em>Only if used</em>: To provide location-based features. Background location access will only be requested when absolutely necessary and with explicit justification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with trusted third parties in these limited ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Analytics, crash reporting, hosting, and email providers who process data on our behalf under contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> If required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Analytics & Ads</h2>
      <p>If the App uses analytics or advertising SDKs, they may collect anonymous usage data. We will disclose the specific SDKs in the App Store listing and in the Data Safety form. You can opt out of personalized ads by following device-level ad settings.</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest when possible. While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law. If you request deletion, we will remove or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal exceptions.</p>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

      <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>

      <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Data may be processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards when transferring data across borders.</p>
